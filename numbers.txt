  - 27000s for 1000 permutations on 16 subjects, 10242x59
  - each time point takes 450s (~5% - on ttests)
  - 1.6s for full ttest on 10242x59
  - 36ms for ttest on 10242 data points (16 pairs)
  - let's assume 100 FLOP per ttest on 16 subjects
  - thus, 10242 ttests on 16 pairs should take around 1 MFLOP
  - and if that takes 36 ms, then the processor should be capable of about 33 MFLOPS
  - which is unlikely, I'd estimate at least 1 GFLOPS on the processor
  - thus, we can (theoretically) get 30x speedup - on ttest alone
